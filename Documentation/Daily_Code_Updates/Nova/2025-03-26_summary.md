Refactoring, ignoring, prettying :)

## Updates
### branch: main
- added guidelines to `/Code/README.md`
### branch: solarZoey-code-1
- made a `.gitignore` to prevent unnecessary files from getting committed
- renamed `Card Class` to `Card.py` to conform to naming standards (and so the file was usable)
	- did some refactoring, mostly commenting the different sections of the class (getters, setters, etc.)
